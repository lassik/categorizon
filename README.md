# Categorizon

## Overview

Categorizon is an app to declutter your *Downloads* folder by
mass-moving files into categorized archival folders.

The app presents a preview of one file at a time from your *Downloads*
folder and a grid of buttons representing category folders for files
of that type (audio, video, picture, text, code). You pick a category
folder, the file is moved there and the app presents you with the next
file. Repeat until done. It's also possible to skip files and to move
them into the trash.

Categorizon requires Python 3 with the Pyglet and `send2trash`
libraries. And `pdftopnm` for PDF previews.

## Caution

This is basically an afternoon hack at this point. Itâ€™s very
bare-bones and nothing about it is polished in the slightest, but it
can already save a tremendous amount of effort if you have hundreds of
files in your Downloads.
